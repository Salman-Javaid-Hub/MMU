Predict used-car prices using 402K data points: we handle missing values, outliers, and engineer features like Car Age. Then we compare KNN, Decision Tree, and Linear Regression with hyperparameter tuning. KNN wins (R²≈0.79). Residual checks and feature importance ensure trustworthy, interpretable results Integrating domain logic enhances modeling
